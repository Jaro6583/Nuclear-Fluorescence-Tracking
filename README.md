## Overview
The purpose of this software is to take in a .nd2 data file that is 5 dimensional (X, Y, Z, t, channel). From the Betterton lab, channel 2 contains the fluorescence data for the nuclear envelope. These data are processed through the pipline seen below. The ideal result is a single data file that contains (X, Y, Z, t) and possibly Region_id.

## TODO
- GET THE ACTIVE CONTOURS TO WORK!!!
- Add versions to the dependencies list in the env.yml file
- Build an ArgParser for the __main__ block (make this thing controllable from the command line)
- Make thorough unit testing
- Add functional testing
- Create a clean flowchart for the data pipeline

## Flowchart
I'll add my (approved) flowchart here.

## How to use
Provide step-by-step instructions on how to run the software (after it's done lol)
